I just bought me a great long ticket
I'm gonna use it at four P.M
So you can call your secret love and tell the news to him
You thought your little romance was on the strict Q.T
So if you want your freedom P.D.Q., divorce me C.O.D

I won't be 'round to hear you cry
I'm Texas bound and by and by

You can reach me down in Dallas, a general delivery
So if you want your freedom P.D.Q., divorce me C.O.D

There's gonna come a day, gal
When you'll be feelin' blue
You'll find that you can't pay your bills
With a little old I.O.U
This dynamite you're messin' with may be T.N.T
So if you want your freedom P.D.Q., divorce me C.O.D

No need to fall down on your knees
'Cause I all I know my ABC's

I ain't no college professor
I ain't got no P.H.D
But if you want your freedom P.D.Q., divorce me C.O.D

I won't be around to hear you cry
I'm Texas bound and by and by

You can reach me down in Dallas, a general delivery
So if you want your freedom P.D.Q., divorce me C.O.D
